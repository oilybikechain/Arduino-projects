[env:esp32-s3-devkitc-1]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32-s3-devkitc-1
framework = arduino

; Serial Monitor options
monitor_speed = 115200

; Add the official LILYGO library for the modem
lib_deps =
    xinyuan-lilygo/LilyGO-T-SIM7600X

; Optional: Add definitions needed by the library.
; The LILYGO library is smart and often detects the board automatically,
; but if you run into issues, you may need to add build flags like this:
build_flags = -D LILYGO_T_SIM7670G
